This week I learned that my strength lies in seeing the big picture of the problem I'm attempting to solve and that my opportunities for improvement are with syntactical decisions and paying close attention to what I'm referncing with regards to variables and scope.  My whiteboarding skills are often laid bare due to not paying attention to the basics, so  I've resolved to do one codewars challenge per day (no tougher than 6 kyu) so that I can reinforce these basics.
