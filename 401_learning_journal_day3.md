The past few days I've learned a lot about the backend processes in Javascript, and Node in particular.  Prior to today (Wednesday), I didn't know that there was a queue to hold processes which were called asynchronously and that they would be released to the main JS engine once all previous processes were cleared from the call stack.  

Earlier in the week, I learned that Test Driven Development is a tatic used to more thoughtfully plan a codebase so that the code you will write will have testable, discreet functions.  This is a change of pace from my original method of planning as much as I thought I knew and then blindly coding when I went out further than my knowledge would take me.  It is very slow to code with test driven development, so I hope that the frameworks we will be introduced to will help streamline this process similar to DOM manipulation when we were introduced to jQuery.
