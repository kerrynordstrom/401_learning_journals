This past week has been a whirlwind of new concepts, some of which I feel on top of (TCP server and Binary) and others that are more perplexing (Vanilla HTTP server and Persistence).  What's held in common amongst all of them is my ability to ask better questions when I am confused about the topics at hand.  

While I could absolutely not build any of these projects from scratch, when they are explained to me or I wonder about how they might function, I am able to jump right in with an informed question or comment.

One cool little hack I learned today is that I can type 'history' into my terminal and see a recent history of commands.
